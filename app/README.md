# myNotebook

A cross-platform (Electron) SPA application which can be used to take notes, edit Markdown, create blog posts, keep screenshots and be used as a general diary. `myNotebook` is built using Github's 
[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) framework that be can be run on Windows/Mac (OSX) and Linux. 

`myNotebook` can be used as an example application in using Electron to build a SPA using Angular 
with routing. 

## Installation

Running the application can be done by following the below process:

1. Clone Repository: `git clone https://github.com/mrvautin/myNotebook.git && cd myNotebook/app`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the application: `npm start`

## Packaging

You can package the app with [electron-packager](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager) so it can be run directly from the `dmg`, `exe` 
etc rather than from `npm start` in the command line. This can be done using the following commands from the 
root of the download:

#### Ensure all is installed

Run `npm install` from the root of the repo.

#### Windows

`npm run pack:win`

#### Mac (OSX)

`npm run pack:osx`

#### All

`npm run pack`

## Building installer

Installers can be built (not thoroughly tested) using the [electron-builder](https://github.com/loopline-systems/electron-builder)
package. Scripts have been included in the `package.json` in the root of the repository.

After packaging as per above you can build using:

#### Windows

`npm run build:win`

#### Mac (OSX)

`npm run build:osx`

#### All

`npm run build`

## Using

Usage is pretty easy. Links to add new posts is in the top right corner, recent posts are listed on the left.
Editing a post is done by clicking the pencil icon to the right of the published date. From there the post can be updated, deleted etc.
Images can be added directly from the clipboard. Once in the editor/new screen the `Paste image` button can be clicked to 
import the image and insert a link.

Dead images can be cleaned through the `Settings` menu.

## Searching posts

The search functionality is built using the very powerful [Lunr](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js) search. All posts are indexed and full text searching can be
done using any words.
